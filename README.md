# DeepSemCNN: Enhanced Sentiment Analysis with BERT and CNN Fusion

# Overview
DeepSemCNN is a powerful sentiment analysis tool that leverages the strengths of BERT's deep semantic understanding and CNN's feature extraction for more accurate sentiment analysis. By carefully optimizing the fusion of these two techniques, this project aims to significantly improve precision in sentiment analysis, offering enhanced text analysis capabilities for a variety of applications.

# Features

Semantic Understanding with BERT: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) provides a robust foundation for understanding the context and semantics of textual data.

Feature Extraction with CNN: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at capturing local patterns and extracting features from input data. In this project, CNNs are employed to enhance feature extraction from text.

Optimized Fusion Strategy: The key innovation lies in the fusion strategy that optimally combines the deep semantic understanding from BERT with the rich feature extraction capabilities of CNNs. This fusion is designed to boost sentiment analysis accuracy.

Versatile Applications: DeepSemCNN is suitable for a wide range of applications, including but not limited to social media sentiment analysis, product reviews, and customer feedback analysis.
